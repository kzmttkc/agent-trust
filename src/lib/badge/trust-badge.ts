// ============================================================
// vet402 — embeddable-badge trust linkage (H-1 / H-5, 2026-08-13 R4).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The public SVG badge used to go GREEN "Verified payee" on
// nothing but a self-signed message. A human reads "Verified" as "vet402 says
// this counterparty is safe", but the green was decoupled from the real
// judgment: a BLOCK-scored, actively-draining wallet could self-attest (POST
// /v1/payees/verify) and paste a vet402 "Verified" badge onto a phishing page.
//
// This is the single decision function both badge routes share. Green is
// earned by BOTH facts a human reads into the badge:
//   1. ownership was proven — a signed claim/passport exists (`signed`), AND
//   2. the LIVE judgment is a clean ALLOW (not degraded, not WARN, not BLOCK).
//
// Everything else is fail-closed away from green:
//   - BLOCK          → "Flagged" (red). This IS the revocation path (H-5): a
//                      signed wallet that later scores BLOCK stops being green.
//   - WARN / degraded / lookup-failed → "Caution" (amber). Ownership may be
//     attested but trust is NOT established, so the badge must not vouch.
//   - not signed     → "Unverified" (grey), unchanged.
//
// The machine layer (SDK / middleware) never reads this badge — it reads the
// score API directly — and that stays true. This only closes the HUMAN
// misread, and the honest meaning of each state is spelled out in `aria` so a
// screen reader / hover learns that green means "signed AND ALLOW", not a
// blanket trust guarantee.

// ---- score → badge bridges (中-2B, 2026-08-14 double-check) ----------------
//
// WHY THESE EXIST, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT just resolveBadgeState. resolveBadgeState
// takes `degraded` as an ALREADY-COMPUTED input, so a pure test of it can pass
// while a ROUTE forgets to derive and pass `degraded` at all. That is exactly
// what happened: the payee badge route read `score.degraded` and passed it, but
// the AGENT badge route passed only `recommendation` — so a degraded agent
// (recommendation BLOCK because its reads failed) rendered red "Flagged"
// ("we caught this agent"), while the identical payee rendered amber "Caution"
// ("we could not check"). An asymmetric, accusatory misread of "we don't know".
//
// The two subjects carry "degraded" in DIFFERENT shapes — the payee engine
// exposes an explicit `degraded` boolean plus a flat `signals.flags`, while the
// agent engine exposes `signals.sybil.flags` — so the derivation is per-subject.
// Routing BOTH badge routes through these bridges means the derivation lives in
// ONE tested place per subject and a route can no longer build a badge that
// skips it. Structural input types keep this file free of the engine (and its DB
// imports); `hasUnavailableInput` is the SAME definition the fail-closed verdict
// uses, so "degraded" means the one thing here it means everywhere.
