 * Chain signal weights before manual WL/BL policy.

 *
 * vet402 2026-08-13 — forgery cost and weight must correlate POSITIVELY.
 * The old split (identity .2 + reputation .3 = .5 of the score) put HALF the
 * weight on the two cheapest-to-fake signals: ERC-8004 registration is one
 * Base tx of a few cents, and the reputation summary is self-attestable. The
 * one signal that costs a real, chain-confirmed USDC settlement to fake —
 * x402 — carried only .1. So the product rewarded exactly the signals an
 * attacker controls and discounted the one it does not. Registering alone
 * (0 settlements) reached 83/ALLOW while unregistered real companies capped at
 * 49/WARN.
 *
 * The order below is now cheapest-to-fake → hardest-to-fake, LOW weight → HIGH
 * weight:
 *   identity   .05  self-attested: a registration tx anyone can send.
 *   reputation .10  self-attestable summary; distinct-client feedback is what
 *                   the sybil layer and the ALLOW-evidence gate actually trust.
 *   wallet     .25  age + tx count: on-chain and observed, gameable but not
 *                   free (a wallet has to actually exist and transact).
 *   x402       .40  a chain-confirmed USDC settlement whose owner signed for
 *                   it (getX402PaymentStats now counts only those). Hardest to
 *                   fake, so it moves the score the most.
 *
 * The four still sum to 0.8 (manual is the .2 policy layer, excluded from
 * computeWeightedScore), so the ÷0.8 normalization and every downstream
 * breakdown are unchanged; only the distribution across the four moved.
 * Self-attestation alone still cannot clear ALLOW — see hasVerifiableEvidence
 * / SELF_ATTESTED_CEILING in scoring/helpers.ts, which caps a score with no
 * verifiable evidence at WARN regardless of how the weights land.
