/**
 * Alchemy `alchemy_getAssetTransfers` — the transfer-history source that can
 * actually answer for a busy wallet.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-08-13). The payee engine could not return a
 * real verdict for high-activity wallets because no public Blockscout endpoint
 * would serve their history. Same address (0xd8dA…6045, vitalik.eth, 37,157
 * transactions on Base), same 100-transfer window, three providers, three
 * attempts each:
 *
 *   base.blockscout.com v1 (with BLOCKSCOUT_API_KEY)   429 / 429 / 429
 *   api.blockscout.com/8453 gateway (with API key)     500 / 500 / 500  (server-side query timeout)
 *   Alchemy alchemy_getAssetTransfers                  200 / 200 / 200  in 1,310 / 2,200 / 1,510ms
 *
 * The Blockscout key does not help: v1 answers three back-to-back requests and
 * then penalty-boxes the client, and the gateway times the query out inside
 * its own planner. Alchemy answers the same question from an index that was
 * built for it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHANGE. Nothing here softens a verdict. A read that does
 * not complete throws, the caller still names the missing signal in
 * `signalsUnavailable`, a partially-measured wallet is still capped below
 * ALLOW and a fully-unread one is still a fail-closed BLOCK. This module only
 * removes an outage Vouch was manufacturing by asking a provider that could
 * not answer.
 *
 * ONE ASSET PER CALL, DELIBERATELY. `category` accepts ["external","erc20"] in
 * a single request, and the ETH and USDC legs could therefore share one round
 * trip. They do not, because the legs are assessed INDEPENDENTLY on purpose
 * (see detectDrainPattern): on 2026-08-13 Blockscout served the USDC leg while
 * the native leg answered HTTP 500 on 10 of 10 requests, and the engine was
 * changed that day to keep the leg that DID answer rather than throw both
 * away. Sharing a request would make every failure a double failure and undo
 * that. The combined form IS used where the question is genuinely one question
 * — a wallet's first activity on this chain (fetchAlchemyHistoryHead).
