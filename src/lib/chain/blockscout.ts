/**
 * Blockscout's public API rate-limits aggressively, and it is the sole source
 * of wallet age / tx-count / funder data. That is exactly the failure that
 * surfaced as the showcase agent scoring 48/BLOCK with sybilRisk:"high" and
 * walletAgeDays 0 — a rate-limited fetch throws, the engine flags
 * wallet_metrics_unavailable, and the verdict is (correctly, but needlessly)
 * failed closed.
 *
 * Probing the API from outside with a few spaced-out requests reports it
 * perfectly healthy, which is why upstream looked fine while Vouch was cut off:
 * the load pattern, not the endpoint, is what fails.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-08-13 against base.blockscout.com, and the numbers are far
 * harsher than the "~15 requests" this file used to claim:
 *
 *   - the etherscan-compatible `/api?module=...` (v1) endpoint answers 3
 *     back-to-back requests and returns HTTP 429 on the 4th;
 *   - once tripped it is a PENALTY BOX, not a token bucket: requests kept
 *     drawing 429 for 95+ seconds, and every request made while limited
 *     extends the lockout. Retrying a 429 does not recover it — it deepens it;
 *   - the `/api/v2/...` endpoints on the same host are governed by a
 *     SEPARATE and far more permissive limiter: 17 consecutive
 *     `/addresses/{a}/counters` calls with no pacing at all returned 200.
 *
 * That measurement is what the two mechanisms below encode:
 *
 *   1. PACING (`passRateGate`) — v1 request starts are serialized and spaced,
 *      so a scan cannot fire the burst that trips the limiter in the first
 *      place. This is the actual repair: the previous code had no pacing at
 *      all, so the weekly benchmark scan tripped the limiter on its 5th
 *      address and then failed closed on all 37 remaining ones.
 *   2. COOLDOWN (`openRateLimitCooldown`) — once a refusal is seen, callers
 *      stop issuing v1 requests for a while instead of hammering the penalty
 *      box deeper. The old policy retried a 429 after 250ms, three times, for
 *      every address; that is the behaviour that turned one refusal into a
 *      run-long outage.
 *
 * NEITHER SOFTENS A VERDICT. A read that genuinely cannot be completed still
 * throws, the caller still flags `wallet_metrics_unavailable`, and the engine
 * still fails closed to BLOCK. Both mechanisms only stop Vouch from
 * manufacturing the outage it then fails closed on.

// ---- transfer window: v2 first, v1 as the fallback --------------------------
/**
 * The 100-transfer window the drain check reads, from whichever source can
 * actually deliver it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-13, second pass). Moving the drain check to v2
 * earlier that day fixed a rate-limit problem and introduced a latency one, and
 * the second only shows up on wallets with a lot of history. Measured against
 * base.blockscout.com for 0xd8dA…6045 (vitalik.eth, 37,157 transactions on
 * Base), the same 100-transfer window:
 *
 *   v1  ?action=txlist&offset=100&sort=desc      1 request    1,518ms
 *   v2  /addresses/{a}/transactions              2 requests  18,036ms
 *   v2  /addresses/{a}/token-transfers           2 requests  51,979ms
 *
 * v2 pages 50 at a time, so the window is ALWAYS two serial round trips, and
 * each one costs more the more history the address has. Against the payee
 * engine's per-leg budget both legs simply expired, the drain check reported
 * "unavailable", and the engine fail-closed the whole verdict — so
 * /payee/0xd8dA…6045 answered "Not verifiable right now" 3 times out of 3
 * while /payee/0x0330070F… (0 transactions) scored 41/WARN from the same
 * deploy in the same minute. The first address a visitor tries is the one the
 * product could not answer.
 *
 * So v2 stays the DEFAULT — it costs nothing from the v1 burst budget, which
 * is the scarcest resource in this file — and v1 is the fallback for exactly
 * the case v2 cannot serve. A healthy wallet still spends zero v1 requests on
 * its drain check (tests/payee-high-activity.test.ts pins this); a busy one
 * spends two, which is why the caller must pace them.
 *
 * THE WINDOW IS THE SAME SIZE ON BOTH PATHS. A fallback that returned fewer
 * transfers would count less outflow, and outflow is the NUMERATOR of the drain
 * ratio — a smaller window is the fail-OPEN direction. `offset` on the v1 call
 * is the caller's `limit`, not a smaller convenience value.
 *
 * Failure semantics are unchanged: if neither source completes, this throws and
 * the caller still fails closed. The fallback removes an outage it was
 * manufacturing; it never softens one that is real.

 * estimateTransactionCount's DESCENDING walk for the tx count. Two walks over
 * the same endpoint, for the same wallet, at the same instant — and the v1
 * limiter answers three requests before it starts refusing (see the measured
 * note at the top of this file). So the cheapest possible score already cost
 * two thirds of the burst budget, and the weekly benchmark scan — 42 addresses
 * back to back — tripped the limiter on its 5th address and then failed closed
 * on all 37 that followed. Measured in production 2026-08-12: 15 of 17 known-
 * good addresses came back ageDays:0 / txCount:0 / wallet_metrics_unavailable
 * → sybil high → BLOCK, and /accuracy published that as an 88.2% false-
 * positive rate against addresses whose only sin was being scanned late.
 *
 * The two walks read the SAME rows. A wallet with ≤100 transactions has its
 * entire history on page 1, so the descending call could only ever re-fetch
 * what the ascending call already held; a wallet with more than that saturates
 * the count on page 1 either way. Merging them halves the request cost of every
 * score without changing a single number either walk produced — the count is
 * still the non-self count (self-transfers still excluded, so a wallet cannot
 * inflate its activity by paying gas to itself), the age is still the oldest
 * transaction, the funder is still the oldest incoming value transfer.
 *
 * Deliberately kept separate from fetchFirstIncomingTransfer, which the funder
 * indexer still uses on its own and which has no use for the first tx.
