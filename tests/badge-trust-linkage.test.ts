//
// R4 downstream/TOCTOU round. The public "Verified payee" badge went GREEN
// on nothing but a self-signed message (POST /v1/payees/verify): a BLOCK-
// scored, actively-draining wallet could sign a one-line message and paste a
// vet402 "Verified" badge onto a phishing page. Green must therefore be
// earned by BOTH facts a human reads into it: ownership was proven (a signed
// claim exists) AND the live judgment is a clean ALLOW. A BLOCK verdict is a
// revocation — the badge must actively say "Flagged", never green (H-5). Any
// state where trust cannot be established (WARN, a degraded read, or a failed
// score lookup) is fail-closed to "Caution", never green.
