// vet402 — the machine layer must say what the human layer says.
//
// 2026-08-13, machine-reader persona audit. The customer of this product is a
// program, and the honesty was living entirely in HTML:
//
//   /accuracy (HTML)     "100% counts BLOCK *or* WARN — 1 of 25 stops at WARN,
//                         and an integration that lets WARN through pays it"
//                        "0% means none were blocked, not all were passed"
//   /api/v1/accuracy     { "detectionRate": 100, "falsePositiveRate": 0 }
//   public/llms.txt      "…the same numbers /accuracy renders"
//
// The JSON carried the same numbers without the sentences that say what they
// mean, and llms.txt told the machine it therefore need not read the page.
// Three more of the same shape were open at the same time: /faq published, as
// machine-readable JSON-LD, the claim that every API response carries the
// disclaimer in its payload — while the two key-less scored endpoints did not;
// /api/demo/score called a value up to 5.5 minutes old `live: true` with no
// expiry, where its sibling passport has always published one; and any mistyped
// path under /api/ answered 23KB of HTML to a caller that had built a JSON
// parser, ignoring `Accept: application/json`.
//
// These tests pin the properties, not the prose.
